# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Wednesday, Oct 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I have started with the logical and sequential flow of the HTML exercises on freecodcamp with the Cat Photo App! Today I covered: 
1. The concept of Elements in HTML and how to start and end them
2. Using Headline & Paragraph elements
3. Linking to an image using IMG
4. Using Anchor elements - for both External Links and Internal Links (like the footer on the same page). I used one hint for the Internal Link
5. Commenting and Uncommenting elements
6. HTML 5 Elements - I nested 2 elements within a Parent Main element

**Thoughts** I've always wondered how the HTML language was structured, especially when I right clicked "view source" on a web page on Browser. Now I can relate to that a little :)
